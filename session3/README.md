# Android Architecture Blueprints - Use Cases/Interactors in Domain layer
### Summary
This sample is written in Kotlin and based on the
[master](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-architecture/tree/master) branch which uses
the following Architecture Components:
 - ViewModel
 - LiveData
 - Data Binding
 - Navigation
 - Room

It introduces a new layer called `domain` where the Use Cases (also called Interactors) live. The 
`domain` layer is where the business logic happens, which is the code that determines what
the app _does_ with the data coming from the repository before it's exposed to the UI for
display.

The todo app is too simple to showcase a complete representation of 
[Clean Architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html), 
but it adheres to some of its rules, which work well in a modern Android application: separation
of concerns, high level of abstraction and the dependency rule, which in our case means that layers 
only know about what's directly underneath them:
 - Presentation layer knows about use cases (domain layer).
 - Domain layer knows about repository (data layer) but not the Presentation layer.
 - Data layer doesn't know about domain or presentation layers.

This allows for easier testing and maintenance and recommended for bigger projects (alongside 
modularization).

### Differences with master

 - ViewModels don't receive a repository but a set of Use Cases, which are reused throughout the
 presentation layer.
 - Business logic that was present in ViewModels is moved to Use Cases. This is important because
 ViewModels tend to grow quickly in size in real applications. 


### Key files

The only relevant use case in this example is `GetTasksUseCase`. It contains some business logic
that used to be in the ViewModel. It's decoupled from the view so it can be thoroughly unit tested
in `GetTasksUseCaseTest`.
